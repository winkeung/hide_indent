# hide_indent
LibreOffice Calc Python macro for hiding/unhiding rows according to their indentations

Inspired by emacs org-mode's outline folding and unfolding. Similar to my other project on github named group_indent but this one don't have the limitation of Office's maximum nested group level of seven.
